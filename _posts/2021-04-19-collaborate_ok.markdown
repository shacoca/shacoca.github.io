> Software innovation, like almost every other kind of innovation, requires the ability to collaborate and share ideas with other people, and to sit down and talk with customers and get their feedback and understand their needs.

I can't believe it. I'm about to do something I've rarely been able to pull off on my own. I'm about to finish a project! I'm about to share that project—as in actual sharing...with other people! How did I successfully overcome my perfectionism, over-enthusiasm, indecision, procrastination, and self-doubt, all while trying to strike that balance between efficiently meeting the minimum requirements of the project versus trying to come up with something totally new or at least a fresh take on something classic? Well, it was every bit the challenge it was promised to be. And, it feels good to be ready for review. I'd like to mention a few of my favorite takeaways from this project.

I like Ruby. A lot. I'd known about it for years. But, I had little sense of how widely-used it was. To be honest, I kinda disregarded it. I figured it was just some neat scripting stuff that I didn't need to know anything about in order to make impactful, useful software. But programming in Ruby turned out to be as fun as I had hoped BASIC coding would become for me back in the day. Compared to the last procedural or high-level language I learned, Ruby seemed to be designed to just get things done. With Ruby, I could make pretty substantial things happen without getting bogged down just understanding syntax. The gratification of getting something working came relatively quickly. I was able to spend more time making the code more efficient and robust. This was a very different from trying to teach myself assembly language for the old 6502 years ago. I also tried teaching myself C++—without a project to complete or a team to support. Not surprisingly, my efforts didn't amount to much. But now I have a "finished"* project. It doesn't matter to me that no one is going to use this thing. I think it's cool that someone could use it if they wanted to. The site I picked, The Old Farmer's Almanac, is rich with information. I could spend years including more of its content and formating it for a command line.

Collaboration. Wow! I pair-programmed with my sis. I coded with fellow students on Zoom. I was never the type to enjoy grouping up in school to work through assignments. How thankfully different it was to be talking code with other engaged folks. So, it turns out that I like collaborating! I've unravelled the mysteries of git and Github. Where I once felt like I was showing up at a jam session with a toy piano and knowing only "Mary Had A Little Lamb," I now feel like I'm slinging a six-string over my shoulder, able to play nearly any song in any key.

And there's still more to learn. Here we go!

*It's time to leave this project behind...for a while. It's not perfect. But, I intend to bring it closer and closer to perfection as my time allows.
